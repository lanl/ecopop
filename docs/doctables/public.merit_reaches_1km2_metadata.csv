column name,description
id_reach,unique VotE id
id_outlet,outlet id to which the reach is connected; each independent river network has a unique id_outlet
id_node_us,id of the upstream node of the reach
id_node_ds,id of the downstream node of the reach
inland_outlet,boolean; True/1 if the reach's final outlet is inland (endorheic)
length_km,length of the reach in km
drainarea_us_km^2,drainage area at the upstream end of reach in km^2
drainarea_ds_km^2,drainage area at the downstream end of reach in km^2
elevation_ds_m,"elevation of the downstream node, masl"
elevation_us_m,"elevation of the upstream node, masl"
width_avg_merit_m,MERIT-derived reach-averaged width in meters
slope,average slope across reach defined as length/(elevation difference between nodes)
geom,the reach geometry; EPSG:4326
id_osm,corresponding OSM reach id [move to separate table]
name,name of reach [move to separate table]
names_alt,other possible names of reach [move to separate table]
id_reach_lin,corresponding lin 2019 reach [move to separate table]
dateline_cross,boolean; True if the reach spans the 180 meridian
id_lin_wid,corresponding lin 20XX reach [move to separate table]
path_level,see https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/VotE/issues/105 and links therein
id_reach_downstream,id_reach of the immediately-downstream reach
id_reach_upstream,id_reach of the immediately-upstream reaches [could be more than one]
