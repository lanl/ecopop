attribute name,description
id_gage ,"unique VotE id, negative values indicate records for which two or more gages were merged (i.e. duplicates)"
source ,"usgs, hydat, bandas, rarcticnet, cdr, etc."
id_source,"id provided by the source, stored as a string"
station_name ,provided by source dataset
river_name_source ,directly copied from source or sometimes inferred
lat_source ,provided latitude
lon_source ,provided longitude
drainarea_km2_source ,provided drainage area
elevation_m_source ,provided altitude of gage
naturalish ,indicator for pristine gages; methods vary among sources
in_camels ,"text; denotes which, if any, among CAMELS-like databases the gage appears in. Options are 'usa', 'hysets', 'br', 'aug', 'cl', 'gb', 'aus'. Some USGS gages may appear in both 'usa' and 'hysets' and thus the field would read 'usa,hysets'"
start_date ,YYYY-MM-DD date of gage's first streamflow record
end_date ,YYYY-MM-DD date of gage's last streamflow record
span_years ,"total range of streamflow records, including missing data"
fraction_valid ,fraction of time between start_date and end_date containing observations
mapped_id_reach ,id_reach within VotE corresponding to the reach on which the gage is located
mapped_from_provided ,"boolean; if True, indicates mapping was possible using the provided gage metadata and simple mapping rules"
mapped_dist_km ,distance between the provided gage location and the mapped gage location
mapped_method ,int; provides information about the method used to perform the gage mapping
manmap_da_km2 ,for manually mapping gages; contains the drainage area to use when mapping
manmap_geom ,for manually mapping gages; manually-specified location of the gage
manmap_method ,describes which method was used in manual mapping
manmap_id_reach ,for manually mapping gages; the manually-selected id_reach corresponding to the gage
