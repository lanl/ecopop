column name ,description
id_gage ,"unique VotE id, negative values indicate merged gages (i.e. duplicates)"
source ,"usgs, hydat, bandas, rarcticnet, cdr, etc."
station_name ,provided by source dataset
river_name_source ,directly copied from source or sometimes inferred
lat_source ,provided latitude
lon_source ,provided longitude
geom_source ,"geometry created from (lon_source, lat_source)"
drainarea_km2_source ,provided drainage area
elevation_m_source ,provided altitude of gage
basin_geom_source ,provided watershed boundary
naturalish ,indicator for pristine gages; methods vary among sources; see #110
in_camels ,"text; denotes which, if any, among CAMELS-like databases the gage appears in. Options are 'usa', 'hysets', 'br', 'aug', 'cl', 'gb', 'aus'. Some USGS gages may appear in both 'usa' and 'hysets' and thus the field would read usa,hysets."
start_date ,date of first streamflow record
end_date ,date of last streamflow record
span_years ,"total range of streamflow records, including missing data"
fraction_valid ,number of days with streamflow record divided by span_years
valid_chunks_nyears ,array; each element contains the number of years for each chunk of available data
valid_chunks_startdate ,array; each element contains start date of each chunk (ordering corresponds to other valid columns)
days_until_next_chunk ,array; each element contains the number of days of nodata following the chunk (ordering corresponds to other valid columns)
mapped_id_reach ,id_reach within VotE corresponding to the reach on which the gage is located
mapped_from_provided ,"boolean; if True, indicates mapping was possible using the provided gage metadata and simple mapping rules"
mapped_dist_km ,distance between the provided gage location and the mapped gage location
basin_geom_vote ,polygon geometry; the VotE-delineated watershed
mapped_method ,int; provides information about the method used to perform the gage mapping
mapped_geom ,point geometry; the position of the mapped gage coordinate
manmap_da_km2 ,for manually mapping gages; contains the drainage area to use when mapping
manmap_geom ,for manually mapping gages; manually-specified location of the gage
manmap_method ,describes which method was used in manual mapping
manmap_id_reach ,for manually mapping gages; the manually-selected id_reach corresponding to the gage
id_duplicates,array type; id_gages of the original gages that were combined to create this streamflow record
