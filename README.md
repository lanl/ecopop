# What are "hydropop units?"
Spatially continuous regions that feature similar mosquito habitat potential and human population density. Think “typologies”; HUs are effectively the “grid cells” that bridge the scale gap between ESM (fractions of a degree) grid cells and local, process-based population dynamics models.
