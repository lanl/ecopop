> What are "hydropop units?"

Hydropop units (HUs) are spatially continuous regions that feature similar habitat potential and human population density. Think “typologies”; HUs are effectively the “grid cells” that bridge the scale gap between ESM (fractions of a degree) grid cells and local, process-based population dynamics models.
