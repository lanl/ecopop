============
Installation
============

This repo is not provided as a conda/conda-forge/pip installable package. However, you may install the package by cloning
the repo and performing a live install. Instructions for doing this within an Anaconda environment are provided here, and
have only been tested on a Windows machine. 

I recommend using ``mamba`` as a drop-in replacement for most ``conda`` commands. 
It's a package-solver that's orders of magnitude faster. You can install it into your base environment with

::

   conda install mamba -c conda-forge

or follow the actual `installation instructions <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.

Clone the ``hydropop`` repo to your PC. This will include the ``hp_enviornment.yml`` file containing the dependencies. I 
prefer `Github Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ for repo management and cloning.

Open an Anaconda Terminal window and create an empty environment named ``hprepo``:

:: 

   conda create --name hprepo --no-default-packages

Then update this enviornment using ``mamba`` and pointing to the ``environment.yml`` file:

::

   mamba env update -n hprepo --file "path\to\environment.yml"

Finally, use ``pip`` to do a live-install of the repo into the environment.

::

   conda activate hprepo
   pip install -e "path\to\hydropop\repo\folder"

And that's it! Note that this is a "live install" of the hydropop repo, which means that as you edit (or update) the 
repo's code on your PC, those changes will be immediately recognized. You should be able to use ``import hydropop.hp_utils`` 
etc. at this point.
