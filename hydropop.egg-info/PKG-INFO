# What are "hydropop units?"
Creating scaling units to bridge ESM and "local" scale models

# Installation
Instructions here are provided for installation into an Anaconda environment on a Windows machine. I recommend using `mamba` as a drop-in replacement for most `conda` commands. It's a package-solver that's orders of magnitude faster. You can install it into your base environment with

`conda install mamba -c conda-forge`

or follow the actual [installation instructions](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Clone the `hydropop` repo to your PC. This will include the `hp_enviornment.yml` file containing the dependencies.

Open an Anaconda Terminal window and create an empty environment named `hprepo`:

`conda create --name hprepo --no-default-packages`

Then update this enviornment using `mamba` and pointing to the `hp_environment.yml` file:

`mamba env update -n hprepo --file "path\to\hp_environment.yml"`

Finally, use `pip` to do a live-install of the repo into the environment.

`conda activate hprepo`

`pip install -e "path\to\hydropop\repo\folder"`

And that's it! Note that this is a "live install" of the hydropop repo, which means that as you edit (or update) the repo's code on your PC, those changes will be immediately recognized. You should be able to use `import hydropop.hp_utils` etc. at this point.
